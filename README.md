# Oracles Network crowdsale contracts for audit

## Overview
Contracts are generated by [ICO Wizard](https://github.com/oraclesorg/ico-wizard).
Contracts are based on [modified](https://github.com/oraclesorg/ico-audit) TokenMarket ICO contracts.

### Memo about cross chain crowdsale 

These contracts are used in cross chain crowdsale and represent login on the left side of the bridge.
During each buy of tokens, the bridge will listen to events emitted by this smart contract and create _additional_ tokens on the right side of the bridge. These tokens will be exchanged for coins after crowdsale end on the right side of the bridge using a [Treasury](https://github.com/oraclesorg/treasury) contract. Right side of the bridge is not a subject of this audit.
