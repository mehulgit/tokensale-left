# Oracles Network crowdsale contracts for audit

## Overview

Contracts for this repo are created for the [crowdsale](https://oracles.org/tokens) of Oracles POA Network on December 1, 2017.

Contracts are generated by [ICO Wizard](https://github.com/oraclesorg/ico-wizard).
Contracts are based on [modified](https://github.com/oraclesorg/ico-audit) TokenMarket ICO contracts.

### Remarks about cross chain crowdsale 

These contracts are used in cross chain crowdsale and represent logi—Å on the left side of the bridge.
During each buy of tokens, the bridge will listen to events emitted by this smart contract and create _additional_ tokens on the right side of the bridge. These tokens will be exchanged for coins after crowdsale end on the right side of the bridge using a [Treasury](https://github.com/oraclesorg/treasury) contract. The right side of the bridge which is modified parity-bridge contract and treasury contracts is not a subject of this audit.
